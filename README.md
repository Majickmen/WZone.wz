# WZone.wz
A mod to replace the fastplay mission, with a stripped down single map version of Campaign 1 Because just a small map against 3 scav bases is too boring, but playing a full campaign can take too long.
Not a finished version as there are aspects of the coding, in which i am not yet fully capable of understanding.
However it is a ready to play version of the mod.

To play this mod simply add WZone.wz to your \AppData\Roaming\Warzone 2100 Project\Warzone 2100\mods\4.2.7\autoload and then run the game and select tutorial\fastplay.
No balancing tests have been done as I'm not much of a beta tester for multiple play styles.
Also the final fight in this stand alone is not something that is programed in yet. As it involves multiple waves of reinforcements being thrown at the player once all enemy bases have been wiped out. And i do not as of yet understand the script in cam1_7 to push out my own version. And copy paste doesn't just work, when every single thing has to be just right for it to even run without crashing; like learning prox requires you to hit enter after your last line so a new one has started or else it will not read your last line as even being there...
This is the culmination of about 3 weekends and a few hours here and there just to reach this point.
I hope you do enjoy and leave feedback. I wish to fully complete this project so I can begin working on a Campaign 2 version.

This Version includes 4 scav bases and 3 NP bases and a NP LZ. Units and structures are subject to change to balance and offer challenge, mainly using a base set to ensure everything is in a stable build.
