Currently in a working state, and a 'complete' mission.
Future todo things(in no particular order)
		Add Cyborg production to NPB3
		Add tech to Cyborg factories
		Add in Enemy LZ reinforcements[and figure out how to do it]
		Add in final boss NPB4 waves for story completion[and a reason to need the tech dropped at NPB3]
			Ground assault waves
		Add in all relevant video and sound files to correct queues[learn how to add altered videos to mod for use]
		Balance NP and Scav against Player at each base tech level[requires player feedback]
		Flesh out map details to make it feel more natural and less fake[requires more effort on the graphic design side]
		Add in on map units to prevent potential 'speed running' key bases
		Add initial transport bringing player units into map
		
		
All I can think of at the moment[subject to additional requirements]
